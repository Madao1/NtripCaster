- if a (http) client connects with path "/home", a non access restriced index page is sent
- access tries by non NTRIP clients now with right message ("... 400 Bad Request")
- order of instructions in function "client_login(...)" changed in order to execute
"pool_add(...)" in critical section and added function call in "source_func(...)"
right before source closes its connection
- removed unnecessary code (->udp, metadata)
- cleaned functions "greet_client(...)" and "login_as_client_on_server(...)"
- no timeout on recv() in sock_read_lines() and sock_read_lines_np() anymore
- added avl tree with connected clients, removed the source mutexes to avoid having to many mutexes and
adapted some functions that locked the source mutexes with the new tree of clients
- source pending functionality disabled
- in log.c "free (logtime)" in several functions added and removed bug "logtime = get_log_time();"
- in functions 'write_chunk(...)' and 'sock_write_bytes_or_kick(...)' changed functionality to
avoid double log entries maybe sometimes caused by twice calling 'kick_connection(...)' ('for' loop
in 'write_chunk(...)')
- order of instructions in source_login(...) changed to check mountpoint and add source mutex protected
- slightly changed the functions involved in connecting the relays
- access log entries now separated by ',' (csv format)
- new config file settings: ntripinfourl, ntripservername, ntripoperator, ntripoperatorurl and
sourcetablefile
- renamed config file settings: logfile to logfilename, accessfile to accessfilename and usagefile to usagefilename
- renamed "shutdown" command to "resync"
- changed order of instructions in 'client_login', clearer distinction between ntrip and not-ntrip clients
- added directory "ntripcaster/var"
- added a watchdog thread, that changes the modified and access time of the file "watchdog" in "ntripcaster/var"
periodically. In file "caster-pid" the pid of the ntripcaster process is written.
- sourcetable.dat.upd renamed to sourcetable.dat.utd and will can now be found in the "ntripcaster/var" directory
- logfiles stats...log and statshtml...log are no longer written
- writing starttime or uptime of the server now uses file "starttime" in "ntripcaster/var" (if available)
- functions "thread_mutex_(un)lock" only call "thread_get_mythread" now, if DEBUG_MUTEXES is defined
- if you want daily logfiles define DAILY_LOGFILES in ntripcaster.h
