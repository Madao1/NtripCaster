Installation from source:

* To use this procedure, you'll need a c compiler (such as gcc) and GNU make. 

There are mainly two different installation types for this caster:

- Run "./configure --enable-fsstd" if you want standard installation. The path
  may slightly vary depending on the system:
  Caster-Executable:  /usr/sbin
  Startskripts:       /usr/bin
  Configuration:      /etc/ntripcaster
  Runtime test files: /var/run/ntripcaster
  Log files:          /var/log/ntripcaster
  Templates:          /usr/share/ntripcaster/templates
- Run "./configure" install the software in one place. 
  The default (again depends on the system) is "/usr/local/ntripcaster"
  but if you do not want the server to be installed in "/usr/local/ntripcaster" 
  specify the desired path with "./configure --prefix=<path>" 
  (both refered as $path in following text):
  Caster-Executable:  $path/sbin
  Startskripts:       $path/bin
  Configuration:      $path/conf
  Runtime test files: $path/var
  Log files:          $path/logs
  Log files:          $path/templates

- You may add options to configure like --with-libwrap or --with-crypt if you
  want tcp_wrapper and crypted password (or either). If you don't want readline
  support, add --without-readline. More options are shown with configure --help.

- Check the Makefile and see that it looks ok to you. Add optimization flags
  for your architecture to the CFLAGS entry if you want better performance.
  Best is to do this before Configure call like that:
  CFLAGS="...flags..." ./configure ...configure_args...

- Run 'make' (or if that gives you a silly error, try 'gmake')

- Run 'make install' (or gmake install). After that, the server files will be
  installed in the mentioned paths.

- Read README file to find out how to configure and use.

- Connect sources and clients.
